## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- SASS

### What I learned

What I learned before working this challenge is the methodologies and architectures from Frontend Mentor "Advanced CSS techniques". There was three popular methodologies, which is BEM (Block, Element, Modifier), CUBE CSS, and SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS). In this challenge, I learned and applied BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) with CSS in the beginning, but after that I changed from CSS to SASS not need to write the long class name.
